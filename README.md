# odin-recipes
This will be a fun project for me. As I have only spent a handful of hours following allong with curriculum, as well as playing with some HTML, this will be a new experience.
I will be very excited to share my recipes with everyone here!
I can't wait to see what I can learn and what I will be able to create a I continue through this course and prepare something delicious along the way.
I do all of this hard, laborous work for my little medveed, LUKA!

This current project is a list of my favorite recipes.
At the end of this project I will have demonstrated my ability to write HTML and create a basic, yet functional webpage.
